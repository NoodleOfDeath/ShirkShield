# ShirkShield

A simple two component device that can lock a computer screen when a motion sensor is triggered

## Quick Start

First download the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)

You will need to program both devices separately using the Arduino IDE.

## Schematics

Schematics were designed using the [EasyEDA](https://easyeda.com/). The source files and exported Gerber files are included in the [schematics](https://github.com/NoodleOfDeath/ShirkShield/blob/main/schematics) directory.
